\title{Flexible flow-normalization confidence intervals}
\usage{
flexFNci(eList, rs0cy, rs1cy, windowFlex = 15, run.parallel = TRUE,
  nBoot = 100, blockLength = 200, repSeed = 1000, runCI = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least the Daily, Sample, and INFO dataframes. Created from the EGRET package, after running \code{\link[EGRET]{modelEstimation}}.}

\item{rs0cy}{is the calendar year that we want to be the first period for RS - response surface. 
When we want water years, these are set to the year prior to the desired water year}

\item{rs1cy}{is the calendar year that we want to be the second period for RS}

\item{windowFlex}{interger how big of window}

\item{run.parallel}{logical to run bootstrapping in parallel or not}

\item{nBoot}{integer maximum number of replicates (called Mmax in paper)}

\item{blockLength}{integer size of subset.}

\item{repSeed}{setSeed value}

\item{runCI}{logical to run the confident interval calculations or not}
}
